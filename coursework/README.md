* Comments:
>The report gives a very good introduction to the data structure, which belongs to group B in the coursework.  The operations supported by the data structure are thoroughly discussed.  Important applications of the data structure are mentioned.  The time complexity of the main operations are stated.  The ideas behind the time complexity analysis are not described in sufficient detail.  There is little or no evidence for rigorous derivation of time complexities.
>
>The implementation of the data structure is partly based on existing code.  The quality of the implementation is very good, and the code compiles without problems on the School's servers.  The source code is documented.  A real world data set has been chosen.  The data set if of significant size.  The experimental procedure is described in detail.  The experimental results are discussed and interpreted.
>
>The quality of writing, including spelling and grammar, is excellent.
